# Hazel-Game-Engine
This repository contains the ongoing development of a custom game engine, built step-by-step following the guidance of   
**The Cherno's** [game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). This series, now complete, covers the process of 
creating a simple game engine using C++. I am revisiting and implementing the lessons from these videos to deepen 
my understanding and build the engine alongside the tutorial.

This project serves as both a learning experience and a foundation for further engine development.
